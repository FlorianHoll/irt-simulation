# IRT simulation

The goal of this simulation is to simulate the behavior of multidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) estimation in R 
with the package `mirt` under different sample sizes, number of items and parameters.
The ultimate goal is to find out the minimal sample size that is necessary in order to obtain sensible estimates for multidimensional IRT models.
